## Problem Statement
EXPA, an apolitical and areligious organization committed to fostering positive change in society, runs a 2-day in-person training program called 'The CADET Program' across India. The program focuses on developing confident and articulate NCC cadets with skills in Communication, Critical Thinking, Ethics, and Gender Sensitivity. EXPA requires a comprehensive platform to manage and engage trainees, trainers, and administrators effectively.

The solution should include:
Registration for trainees and trainers
Interactive learning modules
Engaging assessments
Trainer alignment to camp locations
Automated reminders and notifications
Peer feedback mechanisms
Continued post-camp engagement
